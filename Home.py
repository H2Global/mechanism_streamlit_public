st.markdown("""The purpose of the H2Global Foundation is to promote the protection of the environment and the climate as well as foster the promotion of science and research.""")
st.markdown("""Our mission is to accelerate the emergence of markets for clean hydrogen and other zero- and low-emission technologies worldwide. We achieve this through market-based instruments, such as the H2Global mechanism, implemented by our subsidiary Hintco.""")

st.header("""What we focus on""")

st.markdown("""In line with the Paris Agreement, countries around the world have set themselves ambitious climate goals. These require significant changes in all sectors of the economy. The transition towards a CO2-neutral future will require, among others, enhanced energy efficiency; the ramp-up of renewable energy; electrification whenever possible; and the broad adoption of low-emission technologies such as clean hydrogen and its derivatives.""") 
st.markdown("""Clean hydrogen is expected to play a large role in mitigating emissions from otherwise hard-to-decarbonize sectors, while also providing an alternative for long-duration energy storage. Hydrogen is a gaseous chemical element that can act as an energy carrier and be used as fuel to store, move, and deliver energy. In its combustion, it emits only water as a by-product and is hence seen as key to decarbonizing otherwise greenhouse gas-emitting sources of energy. Hydrogen is projected to significantly help decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors such as iron and steel production, the chemical industry, as well as heavy-duty transport. Employing clean hydrogen in current industrial uses focusing on petroleum refining and ammonia production could also bring significant reductions in global CO2 emissions. Looking beyond emissions reduction as a key characteristic of hydrogen production, clean hydrogen can also bring resilience to countries that are pursuing energy independence and diversification, thanks to the fact that it can be produced domestically from multiple feedstocks using diverse technologies. Political momentum behind clean hydrogen remains strong—over 60 countries have announced hydrogen strategies, for example—but deployment is not taking off: as of 2024, only a very small percentage of announced hydrogen projects are under construction or have reached final investment decision. The market for clean hydrogen is still in its infancy, with limited liquidity, no market prices, legal uncertainty, and multiple barriers to entry.""")
